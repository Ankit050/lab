# Distribution of Project and Examples

Compressed archives of the generated Lab distribution are available for download:

- [Lab distribution (tar.gz archive)](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/tarball/gh-pages) _(32MB)_
- [Lab distribution (zip archive)](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/zipball/gh-pages) _(42MB)_

Download and expand one of these archives to create a folder named `concord-consortium-lab-xxxxxxx`.
The seven characters at the end of the archive filename are the first seven characters of the git
commit SHA.

To access the content on your local you will need to serve the files from a web server running on your
local computer. Once there open the file index.html in the expanded archive.

For example Chrome generates this error when I try and load the sample Oil and Water Interactive directly
from my filesystem:

    XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///Users/stephen/Downloads/concord-consortium-lab-9771ec6/interactives/samples/1-oil-and-water-shake.json.
    Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
