## HTML and CSS Generation

[Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) is used to generate most of the HTML in the `public/` directory.

[kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) is used to generate `readme.html` in `public/` from Mardown markup.

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is used to generate the CSS assets. The Sass markup may be in the form of
`*.sass` or `*.scss` files

The [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/) library of Sass mixins is included.
