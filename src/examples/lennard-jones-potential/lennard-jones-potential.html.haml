      %h2 About the Lennard-Jones potential graph
      %p
        The Lennard-Jones potential is a relatively-simple mathematical model describing the potential
        energy \(V_{LJ}\) between a pair of neutral atoms or molecules as a function of both the depth 
        of the potential well: \(\varepsilon\) (epsilon) and the distance in unitis of radius where the 
        potential is zero \(\sigma\) (sigma).
      %p
        $$V_{LJ}=4\varepsilon \left[ \left( \dfrac {\sigma } {r}\right) ^{12}-\left( \dfrac {\sigma } {r}\right) ^{6}\right]$$
      %p
        The force between two neutral atoms is the derivative of the Lennard-Jones potential. 
      %p
        The slope of the potential function at the point where the potential is zero \(\sigma\) (sigma)
        is negative so when two neutral atoms have a separation of \(\sigma\) radii there is a repulsive force.
      %p
        The slope of the potential function at \(\varepsilon\) (epsilon), the maximum depth of the potential
        well is zero. At this distance two neutral atoms have experience zero forces.
      %p
        As the distance between two atoms becomes larger than the \(\varepsilon\) point the slope of the 
        potential function becomes positve and two neutral atoms experience a diminishing attractive
        force.
      %p
        In the graph above you can change effective the force as a function of distance by either
        changing the depth of the potential well by dragging \(\varepsilon\) (epsilon) up and down 
        or changing the zero point for the potential by dragging \(\sigma\) (sigma) left and right.
