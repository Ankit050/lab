  <!-- begin Chrome zoom bug workaround

    Force browser to reparse styles and media queries on all window resize events, including page
    zoom. Works around Chromium bug in which media queries are not re-evaluated on page zoom.

      <p>What you see here is a work-in-progress version of a new &ldquo;molecules view&rdquo; for
         the Lab project. The nice feature of this view is that, for the web designer, it behaves
         almost exactly like a familar HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with a few extra
         properties that can be customized using pure CSS. For developers, this means that page
         layout concerns can be handled the same way for molecule views as it is for other elements
         of an activity or interactive.

      <p>In particular, it will be possible to apply standard
         <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/">responsive design</a> techniques to Lab
         pages without having to make special exceptions for molecule views. This will greatly
         help traditional web designers work effectively with the project. For example, the axis
         labels and title of the graph on this page were customized for legibility and
         attractiveness at different window sizes using standard CSS techniques, and would be
         further tweakable by a web designer. Developers can therefore concern themselves with
         semantics and leave layout details to designers (or leave layout details for the times when
          they put on their &ldquo;designer&rdquo; cap.)

      <p>In this example, CSS media queries are used to adjust the width of the molecules view when
         the window width changes, with the browser automatically maintaining the height of the view
         to maintain the aspect ratio that was determined when the model initially loaded.
         (This is analagous to the way images are handled in HTML.)

      <p>If you wanted to make sure the molecule view always fit in the page <em>height</em>, you
         could leave the width unspecified and use a height media query, or a one-line jQuery
         window-resize handler, to set the height of the DOM element containing the molecule
         view&mdash;no special communication with or knowledge of the Lab molecules view is
         required.
