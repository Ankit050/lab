  <!-- begin Chrome zoom bug workaround

    Force browser to reparse styles and media queries on all window resize events, including page
    zoom. Works around Chromium bug in which media queries are not re-evaluated on page zoom.

      <p>What you see here is a work-in-progress version of a new &ldquo;molecules view&rdquo; for
         the Lab project. The nice feature of this view is that it behaves almost exactly like an
         HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element and doesn't &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; the CSS stylesheet
         of the document that contains it (in particular, it doesn't modify the em size, and
         therefore the text rendering, of its containing document.)

      <p>What that means for developers and users of the Lab project is that they can adjust the
         size and behavior using the same CSS (or Javascript) techniques that you would use for
         any other elements on a page. In particular, it will be possible to apply standard
         <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/">responsive design</a> techniques to Lab
         pages without having to make special exceptions for molecule views. This will greatly
         help traditional web designers work effectively with the project.

      <p>This particular molecules view scales smoothly with the width of the page. <em>However,
         that behavior is determined entirely by the CSS applied to it.</em> You could have a fixed
         width, with the height being determined by the model contents. On the other hand, if you wanted to make sure the molecule view always fit in the page <em>height</em>, you could
         leave the width unspecified and use a height media query, or a one-line jQuery
         window-resize handler, to set the height of the DOM element containing the molecule
         view&mdash;no special communication with or knowledge of the Lab molecules view is
         required.
