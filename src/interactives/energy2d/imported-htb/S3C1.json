  "about": "The rate of heat conduction depends on how far heat has to travel (*L*),\nas described below:\n\n\n\n<center markdown=\"1\"> | Δ*Q*/Δ*t* = -*k**A*Δ*T*/***L*** |\n{: cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"0\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"}\n\n </center>\n\n(This formula says that the heat transfer rate is *inversely*\nproportional to the distance heat has to travel.)\n\nThis model has two situations for you to compare. On the left are two\nseparate heat sources with a constant temperature. On the right are two\nseparate objects with a thermometer that measures how much heat has been\nconducted. The upper test piece is twice as long as the lower one. Both\nare made of the same material. This would be like a thick wall compared\nto a thin one.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n\nAfter you observe the model, answer the questions in your workbook.\n\n",
