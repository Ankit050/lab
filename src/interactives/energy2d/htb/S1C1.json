    "**Note:** that the specific heats of the two rectangular objects are different. Your task is to change the size of one or both",

    "1.  To change the size of an object, click and drag the small yellow rectangles at its edges.",
    "2.  **Make sure that the objects still touch each other but do not overlap and there is a thermometer in each object.**",
    "3.  Run the model and wait until the temperatures do not change any further.",
    "4.  If the final temperatures are close to 25°C (within 1°C), write down the sizes of the objects in your workbook.",
    "5.  Otherwise, Reset the model, resize the objects, and run the model again until the final temperatures",

    "You may use the grid and the ruler as visual assistance when you drag the rectangles.",
