  "about": "The total energy radiated by an object per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of \nits absolute temperature T (in Kelvin):\nP=εσAT4\nwhere A is the surface area of the object, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and ε is the\nemissivity of the object's material. This is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.\n\nThe emissivities of materials vary. If the object is a perfect black body, ε=1.\nMetals tend to have a very low emissivity. Water and paper, on the other hand, have high emissivity (0.95).\nThe following model shows the temperature dependence of the radiation power.\nImportant Note: Light radiation from the hot plate is represented by a limited number of rays,\neach of which travels at a much slower speed than the speed of light. This is a computational\napproximation that does not reflect the nature of light energy.",
