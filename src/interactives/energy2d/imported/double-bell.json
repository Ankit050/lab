  "about": "A rocket stove mass heater is an innovative and efficient space heating system.\nMultiple small bells are effective in heat extraction than a single big bell, the total volume can be smaller too.\nThey can be arranged in many ways, at the side or on top of another. The top arrangement is used to place a baking oven in one of them.\nThe following simulation is a double-bell model designed by Martin Karl Waldenburg from Germany.",
