  "about": "The change of thermal energy, or heat, Q in an object when its temperature changes from T1 to T2 is\n\nQ=ρVc(T2-T1)\nwhere ρ is the density, V is the volume, and c is the specific heat.\n \nImagine an object is placed into a completely insulated box filled with water (see the image below). The initial temperatures of the object and the water may be different. \nThe water will either warm up or cool down through the diffusion of thermal energy. The direction of\nheat diffusion depends on the difference of the initial temperatures. Two physical laws dictate that the following things must happen:\n\nThe thermal energy that flows into or out of the water in the box is:\n\nQwat=ρwatVwatcwat(Tfinal-Twat)\nThe thermal energy that out of or into the object is:\n\nQobj=ρobjVobjcobj(Tfinal-Tobj)\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy requires that Qwat+Qobj=0. \nThis allows us to determine that the final temperature must be:\n\nTfinal=\n(ρwatVwatcwatTwat+ρobjVobjcobjTobj)/\n(ρwatVwatcwat+ρobjVobjcobj)\n\nComputer modeling provides opportunities of virtual experimentation, \nwhich could make the understanding of the above concepts more concrete. \nThe model below presents a dynamic view of how heat transfer actually happens between\nthe test piece and the water, as opposed to just providing a value of final temperature.\n\nIn the model, there are two thermometers for monitoring the temperatures inside \nand outside the test piece. While the model is running, you can turn a graph on to view the temperatures \nrecorded by the thermometers. The following things can be explored with this model (remember to reset the simulation\nusing the \"Reset\" button before you change the model):",
