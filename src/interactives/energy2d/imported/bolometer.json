  "about": "A bolometer consists of a radiation absorber connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal conductor. \nThe radiation on the absorber raises its temperature above that of the reservoir: The greater the radiation intensity, the more energy the absorber absorbs, \nand the higher its temperature rises. Hence, a bolometer can be used to measure radiation intensity.",
