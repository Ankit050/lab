  "about": "This simulation illustrates the accuracy of our heat solver by testing how well it observes the Law of Conservation of Energy (aka the First Law of Thermodynamics).\nThe following model simulates a completely insulative system (i.e., no heat in, no heat out) using a thermal boundary of zero heat flux. As you can see, as the time step\nincreases, the precision decreases. But a small time step (0.01s) is capable of maintaining the total thermal energy at a level as accurate as 99.99% for as long as\nthe simulation runs, regardless of the complexity of the structures in the system!",
