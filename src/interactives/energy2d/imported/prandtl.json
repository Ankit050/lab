  "about": "Both conduction and convection happen in fluids. As heat transfer through both processes reduces \nthe temperature difference, they can be considered as competing against each other in transferring heat.\nThere are many different types of fluids, such as air, water, oil, or mercury.\nThe rates of conduction and convection vary in different fluids. \nSometimes, conduction dominates. Other times, convection dominates. The Prandtl number is a parameter\nthat can be used to roughly determine which process will \"win\":\n\nPr=ν/α\nwhere ν is the kinematic viscosity and α is the thermal diffusivity. If a fluid is more\nviscous (sticky), the Prandtl number is greater and the heat transfer will be more conductive. \n\nThe following simulation shows how fluids with different Prandtl numbers transfer heat.",
